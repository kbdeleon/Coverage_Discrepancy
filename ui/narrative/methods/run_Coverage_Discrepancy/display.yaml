    Align short sequencing reads to a prokaryotic genome sequence using Bowtie2 and look for regions with increased coverage compared to the average genome coverage which may indicate a tandem duplication that has been missed during assembly.

description : |
    <p>This App aligns short sequencing reads to a long reference genome and
    analyzes the sequencing depth for discrepancies of increased coverage that
    suggest a tandem duplication may have been missed in the assembly
    process.</p>

    <p>Currently, the minimum size for a region of increased coverage is 1500bp.
    This setting will be modifiable in future iterations of this app.  Also,
    this app currently flags regions with >1.5x average coverage, but this will
    also be modifiable in future iterations of this app. </p>
